# renoSMS

**The problem**
Many home owners want the convenience of receiving multiple quotes without the trouble of searching for and contacting contract workers directly. All the while construction contractors want the chance to expand their client base.

**Our solution**
We've created an SMS Twilio-based application that allows home owners to text a permanently coded number with specifications in terms of what kind of contract work they would like. This information is forwarded through our service and sent out to the appropriate companies that have signed up through our web form. From there, we receive their quotes and forward this information back to the home owners so they may decide which company to hire for their home renovation.
